# Vision & Idea

The vision is to create an application for people who need to ventilate their feelings and thoughts. The application should be like an anonymous private diary shared with the world. The aim is for people to have a place where they could turn to if they need to feel less lonely. Where they can relate to each other and get there thoughts of their chest by putting them down into words. The user should be able to read posts created by others and create posts themselves without needing to create an account if they don't want to. The focus and theme should be on mental health.

The challenge is to create an application and a community that is anonymous and safe and where the posts stays on topic and where the guidelines are followed.

Suggestions for future implementation:
- Having admin accounts for post moderation.
- Adding the possibility for users to report posts not following the guidelines.
- Automatic scanning of newly created posts using AI.
